# Constructor-Word-Guess

This game uses constructors and two required files. It's a command line interface (CLI) game that has you guess the hidden words.

# Instructions

*Letter.js* contains a constructor, Letter. This constructor displays a placeholder ("_") and depending on whether or not the user has guessed the letter, should either remain a underscore or display the guessed letter.

*Word.js* contains a constructor, Word that depends on the the Letter constructor in the Letter.js file. This is used to be the current word for the user to attempt to guess.

*index.js* is the backbone of this game. It is the file that contains the logic of the game and the game play. This file depends on the Word constructor in the Word.js file.
